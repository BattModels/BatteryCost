    "The overall cost breakdown indicates that materials cost is a major contributor of cells cost, follows by overhead, then depreciation, finally, labor cost. One of the focuses of battery manufacturers' R&D is battery materials. With the development of implementation of new and better materials, the energy density, safety and life of batteries are improved. The materials cost breakdown function helps to visualize the battery materials cost, reflecting the trade-off between performance and cost."
