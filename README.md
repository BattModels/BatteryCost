# BatteryCost

This is a bottom up 'process based cost model' used for modeling Lithium-ion battery manufacturing cost. 
It was developed in the Viswanathan Group at Carnegie Mellon University. The model is best described by the battery pyramid shown below: It takes as inputs factors such as cell design, material prices, demand, labor prices, and capital investment. Then, it calculates the materials, manufacturing, and overhead costs, and combines those costs to come to a final cost.
